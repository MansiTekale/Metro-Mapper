# Metro-Mapper
Navigate the complexities of urban transit with ease. Metro Mapper offers a detailed and interactive graph of city metro systems, allowing you to plan routes, view station information, and explore transit options seamlessl

#Features
User Input: Users can input the names of the source and destination stations to find the shortest route and fare.
Graph Representation: Metro stations are represented as nodes in a graph, with edges representing connections between stations.
Shortest Path Calculation: Algorithms like Dijkstra's, breadth-first search, and depth-first search are employed to find the shortest path between stations.
Fare Calculation: The program calculates the fare based on the total distance between the source and destination stations.
Metro Map: A visual representation of the Delhi Metro system is provided for better navigation.

#Requirements
Development Environment: The project can be run on any online or offline Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, Netbeans, or ideone.com.
Java Knowledge: Basic knowledge of Java programming language is required to work with the project.
Data Structures: Understanding of data structures like Graph and Heap is beneficial but not essential.
Algorithms: Familiarity with algorithms like Dijkstra's, BFS, DFS is appreciated.
Collection Framework: Some understanding of the Collection framework can be helpful, but not mandatory.

#Usage
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
Compile and run the Main.java file to execute the program.
Follow the on-screen instructions to input the source and destination stations.
View the shortest metro route and fare displayed by the program.
